<p class=MsoNormal>                I asked my group many questions about their
opinion of my design because I was deciding whether I wanted to deviate from my
original design or go with my instincts to make a new one, so I showed them my
original and told them about my ideas for my new one and I asked what they
thought was best and I got a lot of helpful feedback. I asked them what they
thought would look better and what would be easier to code and they thought
that my second design would be much easier and look more professional. I gave my
group members answers to their similar questions of design, mostly regarding
what would be easier to code based on what we had learned from Codecademy. I
think this helped them overcome the obstacles of uncertainty and doubt they had
over their designs and their coding abilities. We were all sort of in the same
boat so I think talking about our doubts was very helpful to get over them. I
learned a lot about asking effective questions because normally I am reluctant
to even ask questions, but for this project, I realized that asking questions
would save me a lot of stress when I began coding my site. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                In the workshops, I used the time to ask
questions and look at the work of the other members in my group but I did most
of my work at home because I work a lot better when I am by myself. I set the
goal to be happy with my basic layout design before I proceeded with any
further coding. I knew that if I made a design I wasn’t completely happy with,
I would be distracted and unsatisfied while I coded the rest of my sight so I
met that goal of designing a layout that I really liked. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                When I needed help, I turned to many places
for examples to look at, coding questions, and design inspiration. I went back
to Codecademy to refresh my mind on the basic elements of a site, such as the
CSS Positioning assignment that involved making a navigation and the assignment
that showed you how to insert an image and make a drop-shadow on it. I looked
at a lot of tutorials online to find ideas for my design such as this one, <a

that gave me the idea for the background of my portfolio.</p>
